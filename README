This cli is still in BETA version. I am constantly working on improving it.

It basically does all of the leg work that is related working with cURL and getting the API tool responces. 
With this cli you do not need to know the exact syntax. It will do it all for you.

I recommend running it from the Cloud Server rather than a normal server. Running from the Cloud Server will allow you 
to login to the MySQL server as well. All the MySQL access from elswhere is blocked.


I will be modifying the look and description of the available options so it would be easier to read.

Once downloaded, run ./API_TOOL.sh

You will be prompted to enter the following:

USERNAME your_account_username
ACCOUNT your_account_number
API KEY API_Key_Provided_by_rackspace_when_you_join
DATACENTER LOCATION it_can_be_either_lon_dfw_or_ord 

(whichever location your account is based. All of the UK Cloud customers are located in LON DC)

The Menu is looking something like this:

	CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:

1 DATABASE INSTANCES
2 EXIT
1


	1 LIST AVAILABLE FLAVORS 
	2 CREATE A NEW INSTANCE (THIS CREATES A BRAND NEW DATABASE AND A USER FOR THE NEW INSTANCE) 
	3 LIST ALL CREATED DATABASE INSTANCES 
	4 LIST DATABASE INSTANCE STATUS AND DETAILS 
	5 DELETE A SPECIFIC DATABASE INSTANCE 
	6 ENABLE ROOT USER 
	7 ROOT USER STATUS 
	8 RESTART THE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	9 RESIZE THE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	10 RESIZE INSTANCE VOLUME 
	11 LIST PRESENTLY ACTIVE DATABASES 
	12 LOGIN TO THE DATABASE 
	13 CREATE A DATABASE ON EXISTING INSTANCE 
	14 DELETE DATABASE 
	15 CREATE USER FOR A SPECIFIC DATABASE 
	16 LIST USERS IN ACTIVE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	17 MAIN MENU 
	18 EXIT

This code is still in BETA version. But it should still do the task.

You will be required to have "vi" installed. 

Once downloaded, run ./API_TOOL.sh

I will be improving the look and description of the available options so it would be easier to read.

USERNAME your_account_username
ACCOUNT your_account_number
API KEY API_Key_Provided_by_rackspace_when_you_join
DATACENTER LOCATION it_can_be_either_lon_dfw_or_ord 

(whichever location your account is based. All of the UK Cloud customers are located in LON DC)

The Menu is looking something like this:

	CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:

1 DATABASE INSTANCES
2 EXIT
1


	1 LIST AVAILABLE FLAVORS 
	2 CREATE A NEW INSTANCE (THIS CREATES A BRAND NEW DATABASE AND A USER FOR THE NEW INSTANCE) 
	3 LIST ALL CREATED DATABASE INSTANCES 
	4 LIST DATABASE INSTANCE STATUS AND DETAILS 
	5 DELETE A SPECIFIC DATABASE INSTANCE 
	6 ENABLE ROOT USER 
	7 ROOT USER STATUS 
	8 RESTART THE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	9 RESIZE THE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	10 RESIZE INSTANCE VOLUME 
	11 LIST PRESENTLY ACTIVE DATABASES 
	12 LOGIN TO THE DATABASE 
	13 CREATE A DATABASE ON EXISTING INSTANCE 
	14 DELETE DATABASE 
	15 CREATE USER FOR A SPECIFIC DATABASE 
	16 LIST USERS IN ACTIVE DATABASE INSTANCE 
	17 MAIN MENU 
	18 EXIT

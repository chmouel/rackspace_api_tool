This code is still in BETA version. But it should still do the task.

I will be improving the look and description of the available options so it would be easier to read.

USERNAME your_account_username
ACCOUNT your_account_number
API KEY API_Key_Provided_by_rackspace_when_you_join
DATACENTER LOCATION it_can_be_either_lon_dfw_or_ord 

(whichever location your account is based. All of the UK Cloud customers are located in LON DC)

The Menu is looking something like this:

CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS:
1 MAIN MENU
2 DATABASES- 
3 EXIT

2
 PLEASE CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DATABASE INSTANCE OPTIONS: 

  LIST AVAILABLE FLAVORS - 1
	LIST AVAILABLE INSTANCES - 2
	GET THE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT A SPECIFIC INSTANCE - 3
	DELETE A SPECIFIC DATABASE INSTANCE - 4
	LIST PRESENTLY ACTIVE DATABASES - 5
	LOGIN TO THE INSTANCE - 6

	WHICH INSTANCE HAS ROOT USER ENABLED - 9
	RESTART DATABASE INSTANCE - 10
